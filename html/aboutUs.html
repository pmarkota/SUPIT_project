      <p>
        We promise to help you find what you love to do and that we will
        encourage you to excel - with the quality of programs and processes,
        passionate lecturers, globally applicable knowledge and encouraging the
        quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are values that we believe in from the first day, which are shared
        by our lecturers, but also by our participants, regardless of whether
        they are 7 or 77 years old. We have carefully selected attributes that
        are a reflection of our values and that are key in creating a clear and
        unique image of our brand.

        <hr />
        <p>
          All our teaching programs and processes are based on global standards
          and the most relevant knowledge necessary for success in the labor
          market. We connect the strong theoretical basis with practical
          knowledge in order to help our participants find what they love to
          work. It shows how successful we are in this the fact that 100% of our
          students find a job within 6 months of graduation, while as many as
          85% of lifelong learning program participants change jobs or advance
          within 3 months of completing the program.

        <hr />
        <p>
          For us, education implies the academic, but also the social component
          of a person. We strongly believe that a person is ready to progress
          only when he finds balance in life. Therefore, we create an
          environment that will equally encourage the quality of education and a
          fulfilling and quality life. Investing in education always means
          investing in yourself. We believe that it is precisely by enrolling in
          a study or education program that we achieve a balance between daily
          obligations and the quality time we set aside for ourselves.

          certificates for the quality of our teaching programs and processes,
          as well as top passionate lecturers who transmit that spark to all
          students and attendees who come to Algebra. On the way to finding what
          we love, there is that moment when we realize that we can do it and we
          want to do it, we call that moment a spark.

        We opened Algebra LAB, a unique innovation center that helps companies,

        solutions that will boost the competitiveness of the economy. With an
        investment of as much as three million kuna, we are the only ones in
        Croatia to have united three key elements - a department of applied
        research and development in the digital field, a start-up incubator with
        coworking space and an innovative educational platform intended to
        spread the most advanced technological and business knowledge. Algebra

          seminar on the use of computers and computer applications. In
          September 1998, it recorded the first significant increase in the
          number of service users, and through multi-digit growth in the years
          1999 and 2000, it established itself on the adult education market, in

          This authorization, the first in a series, distanced us from other
